## Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
This quarter, the most interesting topic in my area has been the guardrail implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Learning how to make these models safe, secure, and private in an enterprise environment has been a lot of fun, especially given the challenges of mitigating unexpected outputs and ensuring robust performance across different use cases.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Q2 project, I would like to explore investigating the effectiveness of different guardrail frameworks in mitigating common risks associated with LLM, such as data leakage or generation of harmful content. This may involve evaluating frameworks such as Guardrails AI, NVIDIA NeMo, and LLM Guard on a variety of real-world datasets to understand how each framework handles different scenarios and risk factors.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
During the Q1 project, we focused on replicating the existing Streamlit application to implement Guardrails. One potential enhancement is to incorporate a comparative analysis of different risk mitigation techniques to add functionality that allows users to switch between frameworks and view real-time performance metrics. This would provide additional insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each framework, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of the program.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in exploring other techniques such as adversarial testing and reinforcement learning to further improve the LLM guardrail. These techniques can help simulate extreme situations and continuously improve model behavior, ensuring that guardrails are adaptable and resilient in complex, unpredictable environments.
